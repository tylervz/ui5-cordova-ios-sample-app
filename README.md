# Hello UI5 Cordova 

This Cordova project demonstrates an issue with using OpenUI5 and Cordova iOS when running the app on iOS 12.

I'm not sure if the bugs are a Cordova issue or an OpenUI5 issue since the app runs fine on iOS 11, 13 and 14.

# Setup

Dependencies:

* Cordova CLI
* Xcode 11.x or greater
* Android SDK Tools (if you want to run the app on Android)

Generate the files to run the app on an iOS device:

    cordova platform add ios

If you also want to be able to run the app on Android:

    cordova platform add android

Then run `npm install` in order to be able to use Grunt to regenerate the component preload file. 

Whenever changes are made to any of the controller or view files, before those changes can be used in the app,
the file [`Component-preload.js`](/Component-preload.js) must be regenerated.
It is generated by running `grunt openui5_preload`.

# Running the application

Use these commands to build the app and open the XCode project:

    cordova build ios
    open platforms/ios/HelloWorldUI5.xcodeproj

Then run the application from XCode.

Use this command to start the application on Android:

    cordova run android

# Replicating the bugs

Launch the app on an iOS device (emulator or actual device) running iOS 12.4. I believe the issues would happen with any 12.x version of iOS; 12.4 is highest so I've been testing with that on an emulator.

Press the Show Today's Date button. Instead of showing a toast with today's date, the page appears to refresh. This is the JavaScript line that's not executing as expected:
```
DateFormat.getDateTimeInstance({ pattern: "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.S" });
```

Press the Filter icon button at the top right of the home page.
Instead of showing the Dialog with a `sap.m.DatePicker`, the page appears to refresh.
If you were to remove the `DatePicker` from the dialog and the corresponding code in the controller, the dialog would open fine on iOS 12.

Press the Go To Detail Page button. The app crashes rather than showing the page with a `sap.ui.unified.Calendar`.

If you run the app on Android or a different iOS version, the app behaves as expected (with a couple exceptions noted below for iOS 11).
Additionally, if you checkout the `working` branch, you can run the app on iOS 12.4 and navigate to the Detail Page without the app crashing because the page does not have the `sap.ui.unified.Calendar` control on it.

# Attempts to fix the issues

I have tried upgrading to [UI5 1.85.2](https://openui5.org/releases/) (because that was the latest version of UI5 at the time) but that did not resolve the issues.

Other versions of OpenUI5 can be [found here](https://openui5.org/releases/). Note that I am not using the mobile runtime.

## Issues Specific to iOS 11

If you run the app on iOS 11.3 there a couple of different bugs you'll encounter.

Pressing the Open Action Sheet button does not open the action sheet and pressing the Filter icon button does not open the filter dialog. This is because "file could not be loaded" errors are being thrown.

I was able to resolve these errors on iOS 11 by generating a UI5 component preload file; on the `preload` branch you'll find the version of the sample app which is using a preload file.
